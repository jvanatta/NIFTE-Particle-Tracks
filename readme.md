3-D Particle Trajectory Generation in Hexagonal Geometry
----
John Van Atta
June 2013

Groups discrete data events into directional trajectories in a 3-D space.
Based on  Neutron Induced Fission Fragment Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE)
time projection chamber data.

Much more detailed information is in 3dtracks.ipynb. Github will natively run the file so give it a click.

Or see 3dtracks_standalone.py for source code of a standalone python version without the ipython wrapping.
